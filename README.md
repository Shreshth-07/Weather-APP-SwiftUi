Developed a Weather Forecast Application: Designed and implemented a weather forecast application using SwiftUI and integrated real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Utilized Swift programming language to create an intuitive user interface and fetch weather information including temperature, humidity, and wind speed for user's current location.
API Integration and Data Parsing: Leveraged URLSession to perform network requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieving JSON-formatted weather data. Employed JSONDecoder to parse the API response, extracting relevant weather information and dynamically updating the application's user interface to display current weather conditions and forecast data in a visually appealing manner.
